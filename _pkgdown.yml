    polyclid: Polygon and polyline for euclid
  description: >
    polyclid extents the euclid ecosystem with fundamental support for polygons
    and polylines. It provide various types for handling such data along with
    basic algorithms for them, notably full support for 2D boolean operations on
    them.

- title: Geometry types
  desc: >
    polyclid extents euclid by providing the following basic types that models
    polygons and polylines in 2 dimensions. The types are designed to resemble
    the basic geometries provided by euclid as much as possible and will respond
    to the same basic methods.
  contents:
  - polygon
  - polygon_set
  - polyline
  - polyline_set
- title: Boolean operations
  desc: >
    One of the major classes of functionality that polyclid provides are support
    for all boolean operations between polygons and polylines.
  contents:
  - poly_bool
- title: Predicates
  desc: >
    polyclid provides a set of predicates about it's types to inspect various
    properties of them
  contents:
  - is_valid
  - is_simple
  - is_monotone
  - is_clockwise
- title: Manipulation and extraction
  desc: >
    Apart from the basic `vert()`, and `edge()` polyclid provides a set of
    functions for extracting and manipulating the geometries it supports
  contents:
  - boundary
  - reverse_orientation
  - connect_polylines
